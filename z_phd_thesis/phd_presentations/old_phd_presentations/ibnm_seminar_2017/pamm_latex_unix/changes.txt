"\vchcaption" is replaced by "\captionsetup{margin=4cc}\caption"
================================================================

The special command \vchcaption is replaced by the combined commands of the
caption.sty package:

\captionsetup{margin=4cc}\caption

The result is the same as before: an indentation of the caption by 
4 Ciceros = 18.0466667 millimeters.

The \vchcaption command was only used inside the vchtable and vchfigure
environment. The replacement should not result in any changes to the layout.
